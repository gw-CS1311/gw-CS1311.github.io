### Course Description and Learning Outcomes

As a result of completing this course, students will be able to:

* See and analyze a problem from a mathematical perspective

* Convert informal English statements to formal logic statements

* Formulate problems in rigorous mathematical terms and concepts such as functions, relations, graphs, trees, and Boolean logic, which are conducive to methodical problem-solving.

* Prove a wide range of mathematical assertions using a variety of proof techniques, including direct and indirect proofs as well as proofs by induction

* Solve recursively defined functions and sequences, with applications to time complexity analysis of algorithms

* Count the numbers of various combinatorial entities, including permutations, arrangements, and combinations, which form a foundation for probability theory and algorithm analysis

* Design basic logical circuits and basic graph algorithms

* Grasp preliminarily certain applications of discrete math to computing such as: algorithmic complexity analysis, digital circuit design and optimization, relational databases, data types, cryptography, AI, etc.

### Course Staff

The class has four Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) who will be responsible for teaching the labs, holding office hours, and assisting with grading. There are also four Learning Assistants (LAs) who will help out with labs and hold office hours.

### Textbook and Resources

There is no required or recommended textbook for this course. Textbooks that can be referred to for extra reading are ''Mathematics: A Discrete Introduction'' by E. A. Scheinerman, and ''Discrete Mathematics with Applications'' by Susanna S. Epp.

  * **Optional:** [Discrete Mathematics with Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp/dp/0495391328) by Susanna S. Epp, Cengage Learning; 5th edition (4th edition is fine too)

You can get the e-book or may want to check Amazon.com for a cheaper copy. Please come talk to us if you are concerned about the cost.

### Grading

**Approximate grading:**
   * 5%: Participation (Lectures, Labs, Office Hours, Piazza)
   * 15%: Midterm #1
   * 15%: Midterm #2
   * 30%: Final
   * 35%: Homework

There will be a weekly homework due Tuesday before class. To be fair to students in all discussion sections, TAs will not answer questions about the HW in any discussion section.

### Course Policies

> **If you have a disability that may affect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic accommodations, please contact us as soon as possible.**

**Submission of Homework:**
  * All homeworks will be submitted and graded through Gradescope. The Gradescope entry code for this course is G3ZEEP.

**Late work policy:**
  * While deadlines will be enforced barring exceptional circumstances, we will drop the lowest homework grade to account for any unforeseen circumstances, so you can miss one homework without penalty.

**Email policy:** You can send emails to the professors or the GTAs. We will answer most class emails during specific times set aside during the week for this purpose - so do not expect an instantaneous response. 

**Illness policy:** If you are ill and it will cause you to miss class, lab, or an assignment, you should let me know in advance if possible. I cannot extend deadlines unless you provide a note from a doctor. Otherwise, use a late pass.

**Regrade Request policy:** 
  * Every time we release grades for homeworks, we'll announce a regrade request deadline and it will be apparent on Gradescope. All regrade requests must be submitted before this deadline without exception.

  * In order to submit a regrade request, you will need to get your regrade request approved by a TA during either office hours or at the end of your lab. Regrade requests that have not been approved by a TA will be automatically rejected. Once a TA has looked at your regrade request and acknowledges that the question should be regraded, please submit a regrade request on Gradescope that includes the TA who endorsed your request and an explanation for why you submitted the regrade request.

  * Note: We will always release a rubric for each homework question highlighting what specific things we were looking for in a proof, as well as what specific rubric items you lost points on. While not absolutely necessary, it would help make the regrade request approval process easier if you came with a specific rubric item in mind that you feel your solution adequately addressed.

**Lab Attendance policy:**  
* Every student will have one lab absence excused for the semester. Additionally, in cases of emergency or conflict, you are allowed to attend a different lab section for the week. This lab swap can only be used twice a semester, so make sure that you are saving them for actual emergencies or conflicts.

* If you'll be attending a different lab for the week, you must email both your official lab TA and the TA of the lab you want to attend at least 24 hours before the lab begins. Any requests made last-minute will automatically be rejected, and any student who attends a lab without letting their TA know will not get attendance credit for that week

* Any subsequent absences beyond the one free drop and the two lab swaps will count as absences and be reflected in your lab attendance grade.

**Academic Integrity policy:** It is very important in this course (and in life), that your work be your own. These guidelines will help you achieve that.

You must:
  * Do your best to solve all homework, and exams on your own.
  * Write the name of any student you collaborated with on your homework as a comment at the top of your main file (subject to the constraints below).

You may:
  * Discuss general approaches to solving the homework problems with up to 1 other student in the class.

You may not:
  * Copy homework from other students or people outside of the class.
  * Have someone else do the homework for you.
  * Copy answers or lemmas or proofs from the internet unless they are specifically provided by the instructors as being apart of the course material.
  * Write up the answers to the homework as a group and then submit identical or slightly modified versions---if you are working together with someone to solve a problem, each of you should be writing up your own independent solution.

The [Academic Integrity Code](https://github.com/GWU-CSCI3411-Fall16/hw-0-gparmer/blob/master/cs_integrity.md) will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully. **Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course**, and are elaborated in the [GW Academic Integrity Code](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity). Note that the _minimum_ punishment is failure of the assignment.

**Average amount of direct instruction or guided interaction with the instructor and average minimum amount of independent (out-of-class) learning expected per week**: 
2.5 hours of lecture, 1.25 hours of discussion section, a minimum of 7.5 hours of independent learning per week for a combined minimum total of 11.25 hours per week or 168.75 hours per semester.
